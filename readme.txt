For all the modes, there will be a separate tile that will show the next color the user must press (color tile). 
(OPTIONAL) Press feedback
For the time-based modes, the color tile will count down to indicate the time left, but for the round-based/score-based modes, this tile will also show the current level/score, respectively. 

For the color tile, the # of leds that are being lit up is based on the firmware, but the specific color will be handled by the software.

Connecting for single-player modes: The user connects 4 tiles, and each of the tiles will show a different color, one being white. The white tile is the color tile, the other tiles are the play tiles. The game is started by pressing the play button corresponding to the desired mode.

Connecting for 2-player modes: The players connect 8 tiles, 4 per person. Upon pressing the 2-player button, 4 of the tiles will light up (1 color tile, 3 play tiles). These tiles are for player 1. After pressing the "next player" button, the other 4 tiles will light up (1 color tile, 3 play tiles). The game is started by pressing the play button corresponding to the desired mode.

Modes:
• Single-player timed: The player presses the tile corresponding to the color tile until a mistake or until the player reaches the 30-second time limit. The correct presses minus the incorrect presses are accumulated as a score.
• Single-player rounds: The player presses the tile corresponding to the color tile for 8 levels. The color tile will display both the next color and the current level. The total time it takes to complete all 8 rounds is the final score. Upon an incorrect press, the sequence will continue, however the color tile will briefly flash red and the time will be increased by 10 seconds.
• 2-player timed: Two players play the single-player timed mode together. The player with the highest score wins.
• 2-player rounds: Two players play the single-player rounds mode together. The player with the fastest time wins.
